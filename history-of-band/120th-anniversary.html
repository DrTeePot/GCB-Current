<p>The Guelph Historical Society also planted a tree in our honour at Riverside 
Park. To represent the Guelph Concert Band, trombonist Bob Randell donned Tophat 
and Tails along with a shovel to help in the proceedings. Former band secretary 
and Guelph Historical Society President, Ross Irwin also lent a helping hand.

at the April 23 Founders Day tree plantings at Riverside Park while Guelph 
Museums director Laurence Grant watches dressed up like city founder John Galt. 
The Guelph Historical Society Event featured tree plantings honourings 
anniversaries of the concert band (120th), the city (171st), Wellington (144th 
as a county), the Guelph Pipe Band (75th), the Guelph Junction Railway (110th) 
and the hotel now called the Best Western Emerald Inn (169th).  The last 
planting honoured the late Alf Hales who chaired the tree planting committee for 
13 years.  (Tribune photo by Doug Halent).
