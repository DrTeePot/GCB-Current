<p><font size=3><b>Did you know that the Guelph Concert 
Band has been around since 1878?</b></font></p>


<p>The Guelph Concert Band was established in 1878 as the result of a petition 
signed by ratepayers who demanded that Guelph have its own community band. With 
the help of Capt. David McCrae (father of the famous Col. John McCrae),  William Philp (founding conductor)
 and George Howard (then mayor of Guelph), the Guelph City Band was founded 
and an annual grant from city 
council established. After being renamed the Guelph Musical Society Band in 1899, the 
Guelph Concert Band finally adopted its present name in 1968. The band has a 
rich and well-documented history including many tours, performances for royalty, 
tattoos, concerts in the community and parades.</p>

<p>Please feel free to browse through these pages, to get a sample of the history of 
one of Canada's oldest community bands.  If you have futher questions about our history,
we have a band archivist/historian. His name is Rob Penfold, and he can be contacted via
our normal band e-mail address. 

<p>Today, the band sports a membership of over sixty-five volunteer musicians (both amateur and professional) who 
comes from all ages and walk-of-life.  In the form a large symphonic wind 
orchestra, and various other smaller ensembles, the Guelph Concert Band 
performs upwards to 20 concerts per year.  The band performs at a high level 
and maintains a professional-standard of performance.  The band provides 
live performances of high-calibre band music to the citizens of Guelph surrounding area.
Performances include appearances: in Guelph's River Run Centre and other formal settings and  
at free community events and civic ceremonies.  The band also puts on concerts for shut ins, 
and other persons of limited financial means. </p>
