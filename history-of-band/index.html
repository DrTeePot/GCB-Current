Band has been around since 1878?</font></font></b>
<p><font face="Arial"><font size=-1>The Guelph Concert Band was established
in 1878 as the result of a petition signed by ratepayers who demanded that
Guelph have its own community band. With the help of Capt. David McCrae
(father of the famous Col. John McCrae), William Philp (founding conductor)
and George Howard (then mayor of Guelph), the Guelph City Band was founded
and an annual grant from city council established. After being renamed
the Guelph Musical Society Band in 1899, the Guelph Concert Band finally
adopted its present name in 1968. The band has a rich and well-documented
history including many tours, performances for royalty, tattoos, concerts
in the community and parades.</font></font>
