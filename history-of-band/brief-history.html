<b>GUELPH CONCERT BAND - A BRIEF HISTORY</b>

<p>Brass bands have held a prominent place in the life of Guelph since 1845.  
The original bands of the last century tended  to be small, with usually 
less than a dozen players.  Their chief activity was leading parades and 
playing at town functions.</p>

<p>It was musicians from these groups who formed the nucleus for the new 
Guelph City Band which was founded on June 27, 1878 by prominent 
concerned citizens.  They hired the famous Professor William 
Philp as Bandmaster.  The band held its first rehearsal August  17, 1878.
This band had about 30 members and a balanced instrumentation.  
Instruments were provided through the generosity of citizens.</p>

<p>Bands have always had three major expenses.  These are: payment 
of an honorarium to the bandmaster, rent for rehearsal space, 
and the purchase of music.  In 1878 the Guelph City Band was 
provided with an operating  grant from the City to pay an 
honorarium to the bandmaster.  Philp augmented this by leading 
the  Dublin Methodist choir, teaching violin and other instruments 
to pupils and earning  a commission on  instruments he managed 
to sell.</p>

<p>Bands have always tried to get a free rehearsal space which  
meant frequent moves around the city.  Guelph City 
Council has contributed a grant to the band  since 1878 in 
recognition of the services the band contributes to the community.  
The grant is  still used to fund the bandmaster's honorarium 
and rental of rehearsal space.</p>

<p>The Guelph Musical Society was formed in 1899 and the band 
became one part of this organization.  The Society now raised the 
needed funds, and provided uniforms and instruments.  
The Guelph Musical Society (G.M.S.) Band continued in name to 
1966.</p>

<p>By 1966 the form of band work had changed and the Society was 
represented within the band rather than the community.  To be 
in vogue with other communities, and the style of music, 
the band changed its name to the Guelph Concert Band in 1968.  
Musicians were now expected to provide their own instruments.</p>

<p>The city required the GMS Band to perform a series of 
approved concerts on the several bandstands in the city.  
These were located in Trafalgar Square, at Jubilee Park 
(now the CNR station), at Lyons Park and Exhibition 
Park during the summer months.  Today, only the 
Concert Shell at Riverside Park is used for 
the  summer &quot;Sunday Concerts in the Park&quot; 
series.</p>

<p>Parades were an important part of band work for 
many years.  The Guelph Concert Band has not appeared in 
a  parade since the 1980's: the uniform is not appropriate 
for marching, members are not taught drill, and there 
are now very few street parades held in the city.  
Instead, the band has evolved into a concert 
symphonic band, 
bringing the entertainment of live band music 
to various venues including summer festivals, 
streetfests, music competitions, memorial 
occasions, and at various seniors' and nursing facilities 
during the Christmas season.</p>

<p>Concerts are the major exposure for the Guelph Concert 
Band.  The type of music is variable  and chosen to be 
suitable to the audience and the season.  The band has 
a library of more than 2,000 titles, although many 
are dated and no longer suited for general use.  But modern 
arrangements are continuously being added at a fervant pace!</p>
