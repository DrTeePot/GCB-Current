<b>GUELPH CONCERT BAND - HONOURARY LIFETIME MEMBERS</b>
</center>


<p>Over the years, the Guelph Concert Band has had many different musicians in 
its ranks.  However, there are certain people who have donated years of hard 
work and service to the band and without them the band would not be what it is 
today.  For these dedicated individuals the Guelph Concert Band occasionally 
awards an &quot;Honourable Lifetime Membership&quot;.  The following individuals 
have received this prestigious honour in recognition for their many years of service.</p>


<p>Bob Randell
<ul>
<li><i>awarded on March 18, 2001 at our concert &quot;Rhapsody and Blues&quot; at River Run Centre with a special plaque.</i></li>
<li>
	Bob Randell played trombone in the Guelph Concert Band for over 50 years.  He is fondly 
	remembered for his fall Corn Roasts which he hosted on his farm just outside of Guelph.
	Bob retired from the band in 2000 on the advice of his doctor.  Althought he is longer able to play trombone, 
	Bob continues to be a highly skilled guitar and banjo player.  As Bob himself said, &quot;I just 
	played in the town band, and had a heck of a lot of fun doing it.&quot;
