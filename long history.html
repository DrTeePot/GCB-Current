<p>Music and the performing arts hold a prominent place in the life and 
history of Guelph from its very beginning.  On August 12, 1927, for 
example, a small band of musicians from York, sponsored by John Galt, 
performed a the first public celebration in the new community.<sup>1</sup>  
The village was a market, and the centre of commerce for the surrounding 
farming areas, but making a living in a remote pioneer community required 
work from dawn to dusk six days a week.  Social visiting was confined to 
the Sabbath after church, and there was scant time for entertainment.  
Music, however, soon became a popular form of individual and group 
social entertainment.  Such entertainment depended on willing local 
talent, talent trained by family members, neighbours or hired teachers.  
Thus as early as 1847, William Wheatly advertised that he offered 
lessons on violin and flute.<sup>2</sup></p>

<h2>Early Brass Bands</h2>

<p>Brass bands were an early form of group musical enterainment in the 
village of Guelph.  Brass instruments could be learned in a shorter 
time that the string or reed instruments of the period.  Bandsmen 
bore most of the expense of performance, although they were assisted 
by paid engagements.  These early bands numbered eight to ten men, 
who provided their own instruments and paid for their own lessons.</p>

<p>In a small village there were only a few people with both talent 
and willingness to perform, and with the ability to provide 
themselves with instruments.  Bands changed name frquently, but the same 
people continued to be active from one band name to the next.  Changes 
in name reflected chnages in leadership, direction and/or sponsorship.  
Guelph usually had a single band, civil or military, operating in any 
particular time period.</p>

<p>These were the days when the cornet solo was featured at concerts.  
A talented player was always sought, and agreeable work was found for 
him at a local factory.  The bandsmen tended to be made up of 
mechanics and artisans rather than men from the business and commerce 
community.</p>

<p>Local brass bands were an important part of the community and responded 
to the needs of that community.  They played at garden parties, parades, 
shivarees and civic events, but they presented very few formal concerts.  
The birthday of George III on June 4 was celebrated long after his death, 
and was not superseded by the birthday of Queen Victoria, May 24, 
until the 1870's.</p>

<p>Willian Sunley settled near the present village of Eramosa in 1835. 
 He had a large family of boys.  Two sons, George and Noah, established 
 stove and tin shops in Guelph.  The Sunley family established the first 
 brass band in the area before 1845.  Members of the Sunley Brass Band 
 included: George Sunley (Guelph's second mayor), Robert Sunley, William 
 Sunley, William Dyson, Berry Bright, Sutton, Colin Campbell, J.W. 
 Colson, and one or two others.  When Mayor George Sunely died on 
 March 30, 1857, the band played the &quot;Dead March in Saul&quot; 
 in his funeral procession.<sup>3</sup></p>

<p>The fiftieth anniversary of the founding of Guelph was held April 23, 
1877.  There were five bands in the parade: 30th Battalion Band of Elora; 
St. George's Society Band of Hamilton; St. Patrick Society Band of 
Guelph; the pipe band of the Caledonian and St. Andrew's Society; 
and the Berlin Musical Society Band.<sup>4</sup>  A consequent meeting 
of citizens deplored the fact that the town did not have a band to 
take part in the ceremony.</p>

<p>The following year Guelph again had no band for Natal Day, the 
July 1 celebration, and it hired the Hespeler Brass Band.  A large 
number of citizens signed a petition which led to a special meeting of 
ratepayers on June 27, 1878, to consider the advisability of rendering 
aid in the establishment of a band in the town.  Mayor George Howard 
and Captain David McCrae led the proceedings, and two civilians, 
two military people, and a member of the Town Council were appointed to a 
committee to establish a brass band, and also, &quot;to recommend that 
such a grant be made by Council&quot'; for the formation and maintenance 
of the band.  The first town grant in support of a band was 
$300.<sup>5</sup></p>

<p>The proposed group was to be uniformed as a military band in connection 
with the Field Battery, and was also to perform as a civilian 
band.  So, the Artillery Brigade Band and the City Band, 
comprised of the same people, originated in June 1878.  
Bands in Guelph were placed on a financially secure footing after 
the town provided an annually grant to the City Band.  This support 
of a city band has continued to this day.</p>


<h2>Guelph City Band</h2>

<p>The Guelph City Band, named for the sponsorship by the city, held its 
first practice in the drill hall on August 17, 1878.<sup>6</sup>  As 
the Artillery Brigade Band, it competed with bands from across Canada 
at the Toronto Industrial and Arts Exhibition in 1879.  The Artillery 
Brigade Band took first prize, winning $175.</p>

<p>William Philp was born at Cobourg in 1841, and taught music at 
Trinity College School at Port Hope.  Philp was also the bandmaster 
of the 57th Peterborough Battalion and the 46th Durham Battalion 
bands for 15 years.  In 1876, he brought the 46th Battalion Band 
to Guelph to compete in the first William Bell Organ Co. competition.  
Philp liked the town, and accepted a position as choirmaster at Dublin 
Street Methodist Church.  He also organized the Guelph Choral Union.  
He was appointed bandmaster of the new combined City and Artillery 
bands in 1878.</p>

<p>Better bandmasters depended on music for a living.  As a base 
income, &quot;Professor&quot; Philp was paid a stipend which 
amounted to one half of the city grant.  He supplemented this by 
his work as organist, by giving private lessons on flute and violin, 
and also by dealing in instruments and music as an agent.</p>

<p>Philp was an excellent teacher of most instruments.  He trained 
John Scoon, a young cornetist, who defeated Bandmaster Hiscott 
of the 7th Fusilier Band of London in competition.  Hiscott was 
considered the best cornetist in Canada at that time.</p>

<p>The military porition of the city band - the Artillery Brigade Band 
- disolved in 1882.  This disruption was probably due to local politics.  
Sir John A. Macdonald, seeking support of re-election, had visited the 
city on June 9, 1882.  The report stated that &quot;a band&quot; led 
his parade.  On June 13, Lt.-Col. A.H. Macdonald placed a notice in 
<i>The Guelph Mercury</i> stating that &quot;Members of the Artillery 
Band are ordered to bring in all articles of military clothing, 
music stands and instruments this evening to the band room.&quot;<sup>7</sup>  
The Artillery Brigade Band had a very short life!</p>

<p>The Guelph City Band of 25 members was reorganized and enlarged, 
and it continued with city financial support.  The City paid $50 per 
quarter &quot;on the understanding that the band play when required on 
public occasions and regularly in the evening during the summer on the 
band stands erected for that purpose&quot.  Rehearshals were held Tuesday 
and Thursday evenings.  Concerts were presented Friday and Sunday evenings.  
Servicing the community by playing in a band took dedication and a 
substantial allocation of time!  Before marching in the Toronto 
Semi-centennial Parade in July 1884, the band had 
GUELPH CITY BAND painted on the bass drum.</p>

<p>Philp left Guelph in 1882 to take over the Sarnia band. He was 
followed as Bandmaster by Walter Hulme, who later became Bandmaster 
of the Galt Citizens Band.</p>

<p>Officers of the City Band for 1887 were: T.W. Hastings, President; 
Walter Copeland, Vice-President; Joseph B. Collins, Secretary; C. Peters, 
Teasurer; W.S. Smith; Geo. Brown; and Bandmaster Hulme as Managing 
Committee.  The band had 30 members and George Sleeman provided a 
practice room.</p>

<p>The City Band and the Fire Brigade held a Band Tournament and 
Fireman's Demonstration on August 17, 1887.  Over 1,000 came by rail.  
The City Band met each band at the station and escorted them to the 
Wellington Hotel.  The first band to arrive was the Sarnia band (35 men) 
under Prof. Philp.  Following were bands from the Dominion Organ Co., 
Bowmanville (29); Waterloo Musical Society (29); Kincardine Band (18); 
30th Wellington Battalion, Elora (20); Wellesley Cornet Band; 32nd 
Bruce Battalion, Walkertohn; the Doherty Organ Company, Clinton; 
and the Preston Musical Society.  The first prize was $275.<sup>9</sup>  
A similar Great Band and Firemans's Tournament was held on  June 19 
and 20, 1889.  Over 10,000 people crowded Exhibition Park to attend this 
event.</p>

<p>In 1893 the 30th Wellington Battalion Headquarters was moved from 
Elora to Guelph.  A band was raised from the City Band, and concerts 
were presented under the name of the 30th Battalion Band.  J. Wyatt 
Trendell of Vancouver was appointed bandmaster.  Trendell was an 
accomplished clarinetist, and also became the musical director for the 
Royal Opera House.  Edward Johnson played flute in this City Band: 
his mother insisted!</P>



<h2>Guelph Musical Society Band</h2>

<p>In the 1890's, many bands in the surrounding towns were associating 
with local musical societies and were changing their names.  The Guelph 
City Band, under Wyatt Trendell, gave a final concert for the St. Patrick's 
Society on Mark 17, 1899.  Shortly after that, a Guelph Musical Society 
(GMS) was formed and the band became part of the Society.  So, in 1899 
the name of the Guelph City Band was changed to the Guelph Musical 
Society Band.<sup>10</sup>.</p>

<p>The function of the band did not change but it was now administered 
by an elected Board of Management.  The Board consisted of a member 
of City Council, representative of the band, and prominent citizens.  
The Board raised money to operate the band and provide it with 
musicians and a bandmaster.</p>

<p>The band rehearsed on Monday and Thursday evenings during the winter, 
and presented concerts on Friday nights from May 24 to September 15.  
It also presented an annual concert in the Royal Opera House in April 
of each year.  Joseph Collins was band manager for many years. </p>

<p>Over 50 people attended the Annual Meeting of 1905, held in the band 
room at Castle Hall (Castle Theatre), 164 Wyndham Street.  The Board 
reported they proposed to raise $1,000 to $2,000 a year to run the band.  
The city provided a grant of $300, about $700 was collected at band 
concerts, $95 from private engagemetns, and $160 from subscriptions.</p>

<p>New officers appointed for the year were: Honourary President, Mayor 
George Sleeman; President, J.J.B. Leadly (City Clerk); 1st Vice-President, 
Robert Gordon; and Staff Captina L.C. Wideman and W. Healey.  The Board 
decided &quot;to reorganize the Guelph Musical Society and the band to 
a more efficent state.&quot;  Committtees were formed, and it was proposed 
to sell memeberships for $1.00; these entitled members to attend 
concerts and vote.</p>

<p>In 1907 the GMS raised $3,254.64 by private subscription from citizens, 
in order to buy new instruments and uniforms.  The Board then included 
J.I. McIntosh (proprietor of the <i>Guelph Mercury</i>; J.W. Lyon and 
J.M. Duff.  They also hoped to get free rehearshal space in the new 
armouries.  The city grant of $600 went to pay the bandmaster, Joseph 
Dawson.  Purchased were four Buffet cornets, two trombones, one tenor 
horn, one baritone horn, one BB flat bass, two E flat basses, four 
clarinets, one flute, one piccolo, one bass clarinet, four French 
horn shaped alto horns, one bass drum and cymbal and one kettle drum.  
The Guelph Musical Society was determined to have one of the best 
bands in this part of the country.  It had 33 players.  The band 
attended the Toronto Exhibition that year.</p>

<p>New rules were developed for engagements.  Rates were $1.25 per 
man for one engagement a day, and $2.50 for two.  An all-day engagement 
was $3.00 per man.  The Society took about 20 percent toward its fund, 
the players receiving the balance.  It was stressed that the rates were 
to be adhered to.  This was becuase the band had expenses that must 
be met, and it had few options for meeting them.  Taking a collection 
at concerts was one method of obtaining money; the other was selling 
the band's service.  Unfriendly observers were soon calling the band 
the &quot;Guelph Money Squeezers.&quot;</p>

<p>The program of selections played at a Royal Opera House concert on 
April 17, 1908, give an indication of the band's repertoire:
<ul>
	<li>Overture to William Tell</li>
	<li>Caprice Militaire - von Herzele</li>
	<li>Wedding of the Wind - Walls</li>
	<li>Auld Lang Syne with vocal chorus</li>
	<li>Euphonia - euphonium solo</li>
	<li>Warblers Serenade</li>
	<li>Hallelujah Chorus - Handel</li>
	<li>Onward Christian Soldiers March - Carter</li>
</ul>
Tickets for the concert were 25&cent;, 35&cent; and 50&cent;</p>

<p>In 1912, Local 92 of the American Federation of Musicians was 
chartered in Guelph.  Joseph Collins was the first President and D.E. 
McGimsie, Secretary.  The charter was cancelled in 1934 and GMS band 
transferred their memberships to Local 226 at Waterloo.  The GMS band 
became a &quot;union&quot; band, and one requirement for band membership 
was belonging to Local 226.  This criterion was not removed until after 
1968.</p>

<p>The Board frequently brought big name musicians to the city to play with 
the band, and then found them work in a local factory.  The arrangements, 
however, did not always work out smoothly: a lead cornet player imported 
from England was fired after being drunk on a band job in 1906!</p>

<p>Listening to band music was an important part of the citizens' leisure 
time in the period from 1900 to 1950.  Regular free weekly city concerts 
were presented on the Trafalgar Square at Jubilee Park bandstands to 
fulfill the agreement regarding the city grant.  Weekly concerts were 
also presented at the Homewood Sanitarium after its corner stone laying in 
1905.  Regular concerts were sponsored by the Ladies' Day of St. Joseph's 
Hospital and the General Hospital.  These were held on the large lawn 
at the Ontario Agricultural College.  The Guelph Central Exhibition each 
September, the Horse Show, and election nights in the Winter Fair Building 
all took time.</p>

<p>The band travelled by train or by carryall to engagements out of town.  
In 1905 the GMS Band went to the Arthur Fair.  They left Guelph at 7:00 AM 
by carryall and arrived at Fergus at 9:00 AM, where the horses were rested.  
The band arrived at Arthur at noon.  They played in front of all the hotels 
and marched about town to collect a crowd.  Then in the afternoon they 
played a concert in the park.  The band returned to Guelph that night.  
Bandsmen were paid $2.50 for a very long engagement.<sup>11</sup></p>

<p>The band performed at many other small local fairs such as those in 
Fergus, Rockwood, Aberfoyle, Harriston and Berlin.  Garden parties were 
serviced at Arkell, Duff's Church, Everton and Speedside.  A popular 
concert place was the Roman Catholic Rectory.  The GMS Band was 
photographed in 1911 at the front door of city hall prior to a concert 
to celebrate the Coronation of George V.  The band then consisted of 
four bass horns, two drums, one flute, three French horns, one alto 
horn, two saxophones, and seven cornets and clarinets.</p>

<p>The GMS Band donned a military uniform for special events such as the 
regular church parade for the Army Service Corps in 1905.  An artillery 
uniform was worn for the opening of the armouries on April 27, 1911.  
The band was called the 30th Regiment, Wellington Rifles, for these 
events.</p>

<p>The very great contribution of the Guelph Musical Society Band 
to the war effort from 1914 to 1918 was detailed in the <i>Guelph Daily 
Mercury</i> in 1919.<sup>12</sup>  Twenty-three bandsmen from the GMS 
enlisted in the Canadian Expeditionary Force.  The GMS Band put on a 
concert in August 1917 at Exhibition Park.  The concert was to 
benefit the Guelph Red Cross Society, and a &quot;splendid offering 
of $116.25.&quot;  S. Carter MPP spoke in support of the war 
and &quot;called attention of those present to he fact that words 
were not appropriate enough for the splendid musical organization 
[GMS] which had given so much of its time gratis to 
patriotic gatherings.&quot;</p>

<p>The Guelph Musical Socity consisted of J.M. Duff, and R.J. Stewart 
(merchant taylor) of the Society, and Fred Lynch, James Reilly, Sydney T. 
Cronk of the Band.  Fred Kelly and Douglas Crowe were later ardent members 
of the Board for many years.  Cliff McKay, a prominent dance and band 
conductor in Toronto, worked in Kelly's Music Store and played in 
the GMS Band.</p>

<p>The GMS Band was reorganized once more, on May 14, 1918, to take 
advantage of the musical talent of the returning soldiers and to 
&quot;secure as members of the band all the available musical 
talent in the city.&quot;  The Board included two members of 
the Chamber of Commerce.  In order to obtain free rehearsal 
space in the armouries, the band had to agree to enlist in 
the Wellington Rifles.  Surplus funds were distributed to 
bandsmen at the annual meeting.  This practice ceased in 1975.</p>

<p>At the massive peace celebbration on August 20, 1919, were the 
Guelph Musical Society Band, the Great War Veterans Band, the 
Highland Pipers under Reeve John Campbell of Mount Forest, 
and the Jazz Band.</p>

<p>The GMS held a special meeting on February 20, 1925, and 
adopted a new consititution.  The Board consisted of C.H. 
Burgess of the Chamber of Commerce, Major C.D. Crowe, 
F.B. Kelly, L.P. Clarke and W. Simpson.  The GMS Band 
consisted of 30 to 40 musicians selected by the Musical 
Director and appointed by the Board of Directors.  Each musician had to 
agree to enlist in the Wellington Rifles. According to the contract with 
the city, the band was required the performance of 12 free weekly concerts; 
it received a grant of $1,200.  The city grant continued during  the 
depression years but was reduced from $1,800 in 1931 to $1000 in 1932.</p>

<p>The GMS Band also took an active part in local patriotic events 
during World War II.  The band particpated in the parades twice a year, 
and monthy church parades to St. George's Church and to the Church of 
our Lady from the Ontario Agicultural College for the RCAF Wireless 
School.</p>

<h2>Guelph Municipal Musical Society Band</h2>

<p>The Guelph Junior Boy's and Girl's Band and the Guelph Y's Men Boys 
and Girls Bands were started in 1941-42.<sup>13</sup>  They requested 
time and space on the available band stands, and this created friction 
with the senior band.  They also asked for financial support from the 
City which also tended to affect the senior band as the bands had to 
share a grant of $3,000.  Alderman Rife stated, &quot;The band situtation 
is a mess.&quot;  The city requested a closed liaison and control of the 
bands.  A new organization, the Guelph Municipal Musical Society was 
formed about 1944; it encompassed vocal and instrumental groups in 
addition to the band.  The City requested a new constitution for the 
band, and the constitution to include provision for a return to assets 
to the City Treasurer should it become necessary.  At the same time 
the city paid for new uniforms for the band.</p>

<p>The Guelph Musical Society Band was renamed the Guelph Municipal 
Society Band.  In September of 1944, the City asked the band to 
turn in the new uniforms to the Treasurer.  On February 7, 1945, 
the band tried to have their new uniforms released.  It failed, and 
the band severed connections with the GMMS to become the GMS Band 
once again.  Good will finally prevailed.</P>

<p>The GMMS Music Centre (the old Trinity Congregational Church) 
on Norfolk Street seated 500.  It was redecorated in January 1945, 
and was used every night by a different branch of the Society.  Monday 
was the Guelph male Choir, Tuesday the Junior Boys Band, Wednesday the 
Symphonic Orchestra, Thursday the Legion of Frontiersmen, Friday a 
Mixed Junior Choir and Saturday a Young Peoples' Society.</p>

<p>The GMS Band was now rehearsing in the basement at City Hall.  
In March 1948, City Council changed the GMS practice schedule - 
they objected to the practice on Monday evening when Council met.  
It was changed to Thursday.  &quot;Two good rehearsals a month are 
better than four poor ones.&quot;</p>

<p>In the 1950s, '60s and '70s, annual meetings of the band were held 
at the Guelph Lawn Bowling Club.  Chris and Albert Robinson provided 
the &quot;meal.&quot;  For example, in 1968 they used twenty pounds of 
sirloin, five loaves of bread and two pounds of butter.  Members always 
looked forward to the Robinson &quot;picnic.&quot;</p>

<p>Band concerts at Exhibition Park each summer Sunday evening provided 
a gathering place for young and old, whether they loved music or not.  
Boys walked around the stand clockwise and girls counterclockwise.  
Selections were made and the young people went to an ice cream parlour 
to complete the evening.  Cars lined the streets.  Boy Scouts took 
up a collection for the band.  After 60 years of use, the old banstand in 
Exhibition Park was removed in Octover 1964.  Band concerts were not held 
for a number of years until the Kiwanis Concert Shell was built in 
Riverside Park.</p>

<p>Band membership has ebbed and flowed.  In 1964 there were 35 members, 
and 18 concerts were performed.  By 1971 there were 50 members and 22 
concerts.  Recently the Guelph Concert Band has included about 40 
members and performs about 20 concerts each year.</p>



<h2>Guelph Concert Band</h2>

<p>By 1965 the band was no longer managed by non-playing members.  
The Guelph Musical Society scarcely existed.  At the Annual Meeting of 
the GMS, November 26, 1968 the name of the band was changed to the 
Guelph Concert Band and a new Consitution was adopted.</p>

<p>The new name was adopted to better describe the band activites 
of the time.  The title &quot;concert band&quot; implies a repertoire 
of a lighter nature although the instrumentation does not preclude 
more serious works.  The band was still funded from a city grant 
which by this time had reached $2,500.  The band did much extra 
work during Centennial Year of 1967, and the city provided funds 
for a new uniform - black pants and a maroon blazer with the 
city crest.</p>

<p>In 1981, with assistance from a <i>Wintario</i> grant and the 
city, the band purchased new percussion instruments and new 
blue coats for uniform.  The musicians were expected to provide 
the balance of the dress.</p>

<p>The role of bands in the city had changed over the years.  
Prior to 1950, traffic was lighter and street parades were common.  
The Parks Department maintained stands for band concerts at four 
locations.  Band music was a major entertainment focus, particularly 
on summer Sunday evenings.  Today, parades are seldom seen in the 
City.  Permits are required and the expense is high.  Most band 
members would need drill in marching practice to make a reasonable 
appearance, and current band uniform is not conducive to this 
activity.  Civic functions are very important but infrequent.  
Only the Riverside Concert Shell exists for concerts.  When the 
band began to play there, it seemed too far from the general city 
population to be effective, although this has changed.  Concerts 
for seniors' groups are now an important programming item.  Formal 
concerts are more common than in the past.  Bands are versatile and 
can provide the music people wnat to hear.  There's nothing like 
a home town band!</p>
